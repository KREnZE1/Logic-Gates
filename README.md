# Logic Gates

This project seeks to emulate the inner workings of a computer by creating the logic gates used to computewithin the machine.

All folders contain an implementation of a complex algorithm taking inputs and computing their outputs as would a real computer. Also provided is a suit of test cases to check the functionality of all algorithms.

Every algorithm is combinable, as can be seen by the NOR-Gate feeding the output of an OR-Gate into a NOT-Gate.

## TODOs

* Test interconnectivity and interactions between gates more
* Add more gates
* Add algorithms entirely buildable by using these logic gates
* Possibly clean up the way of connecting the gates to each other?
